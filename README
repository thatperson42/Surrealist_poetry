This contains a list of word generator, dictmaker.py, to work with
mrshanahan's surrealist poetry generator:

https://github.com/mrshanahan/surrealist_poetry

It also contains the dictionary that gets created on my system running the
program (the program takes about 25 seconds on my computer).

dict_location has to be modified in dictmaker.py depending on the system.
